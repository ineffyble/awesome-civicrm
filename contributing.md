`awesome-civicrm` is intended to be a *curated* list of genuinely awesome CiviCRM-related things.
Please don't submit something if you wouldn't call it awesome (or at least, pretty cool).


Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Any extensions, integrations, code snippets must be compatible with the latest released version of CiviCRM.
- Categorise your submission appropriately. If no categories seem right, add one!
- Double-check that your submission is not already covered by an existing item.
- Avoid self-promotion - adding an open-source extension you've developed is okay, listing your CiviCRM consulting firm is not.

Thank you for your suggestions!
